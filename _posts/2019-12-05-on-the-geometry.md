In my recent work [arXiv:1910.11163](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11163), I investigated the learning dynamics of neural quantum states under stochastic reconfiguration (quantum version of the natural gradient) using information geometry (measured with quantum Fisher information). 

For interested people, I uploaded a presentation file for my talk in the Group seminar [here](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/~cypark/on-the-geometry-of-learning-neural-quantum-states).
It contains an introductory comparision between generative models in machine learning and variational quantum Monte-Carlo for readers who are not familiar with this topic, and some movies that show the learning dynamics more clearly.
